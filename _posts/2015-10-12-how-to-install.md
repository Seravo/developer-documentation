> **Vagrant 2.1.0 changes vagrant-triggers:** Currently our Seravo WordPress Vagrant box does not work with the latest version of Vagrant due to [non-backwards compatible changes in vagrant-triggers](https://github.com/Seravo/wp-palvelu-vagrant/issues/49). The work-around is to [install Vagrant 2.0.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/) instead of the latest version for now.

## Installation

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

To use Virtualbox make sure you have ```vt-x``` enabled in your BIOS.

[Install Vagrant 2.0.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/). Don't install the latest version, as there is compatibility issues with the current version of Seravo WordPress Vagrant box.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y virtualbox virtualbox-dkms
git clone https://github.com/Seravo/wordpress ~/wordpress-dev
cd ~/wordpress-dev
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
vagrant up
```

> **Optional:** If you want to have PHP Composer locally installed run:
>
> ```bash
> $ sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:duggan/composer
> $ sudo apt-get update
> $ sudo apt-get install php5-composer
> ```

#### Ubuntu 16.04 and later need ruby-dev

If you see this error message on Ubuntu 16.04 or later:

```
$ vagrant up
mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h
```

It means you need to install separately the Ruby development files:

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
```

#### Ubuntu 17.04 and later

VirtualBox sets up the `vboxnet0` virtual interface routing using the legacy `ifconfig` and `route`
commands, instead of the modern `ip` command. For networking to work properly, you need to run
`apt install net-tools`.

### Linux (Fedora)

Add RPMFusion repositories. See  [RpmFusion](http://rpmfusion.org/). Repository is
needed for Virtualbox.

[Install Vagrant 2.0.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/). Don't install the latest version, as there is compatibility issues with the current version of Seravo WordPress Vagrant box.

Clone the WordPress Git repo and run following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install virtualbox
sudo yum install ruby-devel # Needed to build native ruby extensions
sudo gem update bundler
sudo gem install hittimes -v '1.2.2'
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs

# Needed to load the kernel module for virtualbox, you may want to load it automatically on boot...
sudo modprobe vboxdrv
vagrant up
```

### Linux (General)

If you get errors related to creating host-only network adapters during vagrant up, run ```sudo vboxreload```.
It seems that sometimes the virtualbox kernel modules are not working correctly after the machine wakes up from sleep.

### MacOS X

1. [Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/): `xcode-select --install`
2. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) (version [2.0.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/), or any other release before 2.1.0!)
3. [Install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (version [5.2](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2) or older)
4. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Seravo/wordpress ~/wordpress-dev`
5. Run the installation in Terminal:
```
cd ~/wordpress-dev
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
vagrant up
```
> **Optional:** [Vagrant Manager for OS X](http://vagrantmanager.com/) can help you manage multiple Vagrant boxes.

### Windows (Cygwin)

To use Virtualbox make sure you have ```vt-x``` enabled in your BIOS.
You might need to disable ```hyper-v``` in order to use Virtualbox.
On Windows 10 you need to run Cygwin as an administrator so vagrant-hostsupdater can write the necessary entries to ```/system32/drivers/etc/hosts```. Otherwise you need to add the vagrant-hostsupdater entries manually.
Note that in some cases you can't modify the ```hosts``` file without administrative access. In that case you need to ask the administrator to give you access to the file.

1. [Install Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) and via Cygwin `openssh` and `git`
2. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) (version [2.0.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/), or any other release before 2.1.0!)
3. [Install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (version [5.2](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2) or older)
4. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Seravo/wordpress ~/wordpress-dev`
5. Run the installation in terminal:
```
cd ~/wordpress-dev
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
vagrant up
```
Cygwin will give you the following message and the necessary entries you need to add to the ```hosts``` file, if you try to vagrant up without administrative access.

Note that this is just an example. Your message will be different.
```
[vagrant-hostsupdater] Writing the following entries to (system32/drivers/etc/hosts)
[vagrant-hostsupdater] exampleIP-address examplehostname
[vagrant-hostsupdater] This operation requires administrative access.
You may skip it by manually adding equivalent entries to the hosts file.
```

On some versions of Windows (Windows 8) you might get a "Vt-x is not available" error. You'll need to disable Hyper-V in bios to proceed with the installation.
Most bios setups have the option under "Security".

In theory, Seravo WordPress should work even without Cygwin installed, but we strongly recommend using Cygwin for doing WordPress development on Windows machines.

Seravo WordPress installation with PowerShell:

Note that PowerShell also needs to be run in administrator mode.

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) (version [2.0.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/), or any other release before 2.1.0!)
3. [Install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2)  (version [5.2](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2) or older)
4. Clone this repo with PowerShell: `git clone https://github.com/Seravo/wordpress wordpress-dev`
5. Run the installation in terminal:
```
cd wordpress-dev
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-triggers vagrant-bindfs
vagrant up
```

> **Optional:** [Vagrant Manager for Windows](http://vagrantmanager.com/windows/) can help you manage multiple Vagrant boxes.
