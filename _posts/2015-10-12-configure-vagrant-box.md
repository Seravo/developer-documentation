## Example configuration of config.yml

```yaml
###
# Configuration for Vagrant
###

# This is used for domain mapping
name: wordpress

# These are used for migrating database and uploads back and forth with production
# Comment these out if you don't want this integration
production:
  domain: example.seravo.com
  ssh_port: 12345

staging:
  domain: example.seravo.com
  ssh_port: 23456

# Domains are automatically mapped to Vagrant with /etc/hosts modifications
development:
  domains:
    - wordpress.local
    - example.dev
    - www.example.dev
```

### Changing config.yml
#### name

Change `name` in config.yml to change your site name. This is used in quite a few places in the development environment.

For example, with the above config.yml [mailcatcher]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-10-11-mailcatcher %}) is set up in the address: mailcatcher.**example**.local.

#### production
Add `domain` and `ssh_port` to sync with your production instance.

#### staging
Optional: Add `domain` and `ssh_port` to sync with your staging (shadow) instance.

#### development
Add new domains under `domains` before you run vagrant up to use extra domains.

See [config-sample.yml](https://github.com/Seravo/wordpress/blob/master/config-sample.yml) for more.

## Using dotenv

The `wp-config.php` file uses [Dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) by default which enables you to create a file called `.env` in the root of your project to override default environment variables.

Example:

```bash
$ cat .env.development
# Run 'ln -s .env.development .env' in project root to activate this
WP_TEST_URL=https://example.dev
DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE=example.dev
NOBLOGREDIRECT=https://example.dev
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.example.dev

$ ll .env
lrwxrwxrwx 1 otto otto .env -> .env.development
```

You can have template files like `.env.development` tracked in version control, and then make a location-specific symbolic link from `.env` to the correct file. By default the `.env` file is and should be ignored by git via gitignore.
